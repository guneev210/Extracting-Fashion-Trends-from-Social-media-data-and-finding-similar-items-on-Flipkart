# Extracting-Fashion-Trends-from-Social-Media-Data-and-finding-similar-items-on-Flipkart
## Description

Social media has become a major fashion influencer for today's generation. All of us surf internet and it happens a lot that we come across some products that we wish to buy but can't find it. 

This model solves this very problem.

It extracts top trending posts from social media and then forms a searchable query on flipkart and shows all the similar products which are then compared to the initial product using cosine distance.
